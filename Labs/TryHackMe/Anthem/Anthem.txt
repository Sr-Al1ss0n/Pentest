---Disclaimer---
Well, this is the first time I take notes of a guilded ctf room and I 
don't know how to make this notes, everytime in my notes I focus in how 
I owned the machine, but this time I'm gonna focus on to ansewer the 
questions of the room, and another thing when I'm doing a ctf I write
my notes but this time I'm redoing this rooms beacuse I already did 
this room with some friends but we didn't take notes, but let's start ! 
----------------

run a nmap (nmap.txt) the hosts is blocking pings 
we have two services 80(http) and 3389(ms-wbt-server)
lets go to web-server,

*I should explore the web site but the machine says to go to robots.txt) 

found a possible password on /robots.txt and and some disallowed pages
UmbracoIsTheBest!
the site appears to be made with umbraco
in these two post on the site I found names, e-mails, and domain 

*here my friends and I got a big problem, the rooms asks for the Admin
name and email but on the machine we did not find anything about it, 
but the after hours we discoeverd in a write up the admin name is the 
person who writed the poem of page 
http://IP/archive/a-cheers-to-our-it-department/ *
 
Solomon Grundy

we have a login page, a possible password and the admin name
I guessed the admin e-mail by looking at the another e-mails found
on a post page


SG@anthem.com

I will not say how to find the 4 flags because they are on source page
and is easy to find

* here has another problem, we got access to the umbraco CMS and spended 
some hours trying to get a reverse shell like a WordPress exploration,
but my frind said to go to "ms-wbt-server" lets change the situation to
a linux machine I got a PASSWORD and a LOGIN WHY NOT LOGIN ON SSH,
did you got it ? *

used remmina (remote desktop) to login on whindows machine with GUI
got the user flag, we do not have permission to access the admin folder
by rigth click and set up the options to show hidden folders I can't get 
anything because we do not have Admin permissions so we I did that

View>options>show hidden files, folders, or drives 
and lets see what we have on folders 

 
on C:\backup we have a file that we can not read but we can change
the properties like
rigth click on restore file>properties>security>AD>*put the user*>Allowed all permissions
and with this we can oppen and get a password now just try to login as

Administrator:ChangeMeBaby1MoreTime

got root flag 

GG!
