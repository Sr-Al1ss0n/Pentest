Started the recon with the nmap and oppen the web-server on browser
in the web server have a login page ("menber login") powerd by LigGoat
I used a kali machine to run enum4linux (enum4linux.txt)
it returned 5 usernames, I will do a fuzzing on web-server (gobuster.txt)
didn't found anything that migth be interesting
did a brute SqlInjction with burp on logon page, I used the names I found
with enum4linux to brute-force a SqlInjction and some requests has redirected
for a succes-logon page, and with this I got a user:password, (something strange
when the request is made by robert account it returns the john infos)

john:MyNameIsJohn

this credentials works on SSH, but the enviroment is limited with just 8 commands
but holpefully the echo command is allowed and with this is possible to
spawn a TTY shell, used the find command to search for passwords is .php files
and found the mysql service have the username "root" and the password "" (blank, vazio, sem senha)
on mysql.func have the command sys_exec wich allow the user to exec commands
so mysql have root permissions and I can run commands, I've copied the 
/bin/sh for /tmp and give permissions to exec and there I got a root shell
