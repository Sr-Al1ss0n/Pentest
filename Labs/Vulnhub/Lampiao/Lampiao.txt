First I started with a nmap scan (nmap.txt)

There is names on web server Eder, tiago
used nikto to scan vulns on site, its returns too many things about robots.txt, but I think it is also false-positive (nikto.txt)

---Gain Access---
searching a exploit for drupal (searchsploit.txt)
Using metasploit to search a exploit and exploit it (msfconsole.txt)
