I've started with a nmap scan (nmap.txt) there is a very old vsftpd version, I found some exploits but nothing that might be a RevShell (searchsploit.txt)
with nmap result I got the Linux Kernel version "Linux 2.6.32" migth have some exploits
On web-server I found a name on source code, and many dir's on /robots.txt (robots.txt), maybe I make a script wich automate this work
on FTP the name Tr0ll (found on source) and the password Tr0ll worked, in FTP i got a .zip file, but it is protected by a password, maybe aI brute-force it
on SSH this credentials didn't work ;( 
I used Dirb with the robots.txt to see what dirs is allowed to access, and I got every cat photos (I hated that, I NEED TO LEARN PROGRAMMING AND SCRIPTING)
downloaded the photos and used ls command to see if they have bytes difference and one have, I used cat command to get the content and found "y0ur_self"
this is a dir on web-server, I wgeted the content (answer.txt) on these file have many enconded words base64, I decoded it using this command:

root@kali: ~ / base64 --decode answer.txt | sort | uniq > decoded.txt it appears to be a password list
after crack the password the unzip dir returns a rsa key and now I tryed to login on SSH, but it fail (try-SSH.txt)
usign the verbose mode "sssh -vv noob@IP -i noob" was disovered the connections is forced to close because have a forced command, and it is exploitable
by SHELLSHOCK, so I got a shell access using this vulnerability with /bin/bash  command
I'm too much stressed to keep hacking this machine, (I REALLY NEED TO LEARN PROGRAMMING AND BoF)

FTP: Tr0ll:Tr0ll
