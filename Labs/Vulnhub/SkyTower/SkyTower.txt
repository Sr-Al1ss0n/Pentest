IP: 192.168.56.101

started with the basic network scan (nmap.txt)
there is a web-server a SSH-server and a Proxy
I will open the browser and see what it have 
don't have robots.txt, I'm gonna do a fuzzing (gobuster.txt)
it apperns to don't have something useful, but the login
on the web page appers to be vulnerable to SqlInjection
I used nikto to do a vuln scan, and Sqlmap (nikto.txt, sqlmap.txt)
got access with the code: ' || 8 > 7 #
It appears to be a info page with credentials to SSH

john@skytech.com
john:hereisjohn

I can not access the SSH because the port is filtred, maybe I need to use 
their proxy, changed the proxychains4.conf 
"socks4  127.0.0.1 9050
http 192.168.56.101 3128"

loged on SSH put the it dropped me out, is possible to 
execute commands in ssh when we log on something like that (ssh.txt)


proxychains ssh john@192.168.56.101 'uname -a' 
this command use their proxy to connect via ssh and send a command with the user that you are login
YOU NEED TO KNOW THE USER AND PASSWORD TO DO THIS

used /bin/bash to connect, but it dropped me again, but it worked with nc-RevShell (/Pentest/Wordlist/nc-RevShell)
time to PrivEsc
Cant spawn tty shell's, with any method is possible to get that, so I need to use everything with a simple shell
any bin appears to be vulnerable
on /var/www/ have the website codes, on login.php have a connect to mysql in localhost with root:root
using mysql without tty, got more credentials (mysql.txt)
got loged on another users accounts
on .bashrc have a function that drop if you use /bin/bash so I removed the .bashrc from sara and john,
but I cant login on william,

with TTY shell I can use the sudo command, and sara have permissions to "ls" and "cat" on /accounts/ directory
used this perms to do a "sudo ls /accounts/../root" and "sudo ls /account/../root/flag.txt" (root.txt)
