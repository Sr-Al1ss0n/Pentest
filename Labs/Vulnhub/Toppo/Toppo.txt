---Enumeration---
I did a simple nmap scan didnt find many thing (nmap.txt) 
I did a Fuzzing (gobuster.txt)
found a credentials on /admin (note.txt)  ted:12345ted123
I didn't know what should I do, but I relise the password have the name of the "admin" Ted
---Gain access---
Login on SSH with the credentials
---Privilege Escalation---
Search for ways to priv esc
sudo appers to be don't allowed (command not found, but have a /etc/sudoers)
ted ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/awk
cat /etc/passwd and cat /etc/shadow (nothing that worth)
find a binary with missconfiguration of permission (find / -type f -perm -4000 2>/dev/null) 
awk looks to be a good way to priv esc to root, I used the GTFOBins to get a command the give me a root shell
It returns me that:

# id
uid=1000(ted) gid=1000(ted) euid=0(root) groups=1000(ted),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),108(netdev),114(bluetooth)
