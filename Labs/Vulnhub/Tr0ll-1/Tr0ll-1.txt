started with a nmap and it returns (nmap.txt)
anonymous login on ftp is allowed so i enter and got a file (lol.pcap)
used tcpdump to read this file, the log mentioned somethings that might be interesting (secret_stuff.txt, sup3rs3cr3tdirlol)
on robots.txt have a dir, but thers is just a meme
did a fuzzing while I try to get more result with this things on firefox (gobuster.txt), on the found dir I got a strange file
Its a executable, but using "file" command I found a "hash" ?, let's exec it, and it returns a web directory (roflmao.txt)
on web-server withs theses dirs i got a "user-list", whell I will try to brute-force the SSH
found overflow:Pass.txt so I logged on SSH, now time to priv esc to root
found a kernel exploit to ubuntu 14 and for this linux version
and now I'm root !
