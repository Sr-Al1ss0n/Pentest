Started with a nmap there is a SSH and a HTTP (nmap.txt)
on web page have a login page, and its powered by LotusCMS (exploitable by metasploit)
used gobuster to do a directory fuzzing (gobuster.txt)
I used metasploit to exploit the LotusCMS and get a reverse shell
got a www-data shell, time to priv esc to root
in a text file I found a root password for mysql, than a logged on phpmyadmin (on web-server /chrome)
there I've found 2 hash for 2 users, cracked it on crackstation

I have users, passwords and a SSH server open I'll login it because it's more friendly
there is an editor "ht" that allow the user to edit files, but all users have root permissions to use this editor
just edite the /etc/sudoers to add privileges to the user loneferret and there i got the root shell
