Found a admin login page, with user and pass: admin
Using the searchsploit to find some exploit 
using ProFTPd-1.3.3c - Backdoor Command Execution (Metasploit) 
with the payload exploit/unix/ftp/proftpd_133c_backdoor
Got a Reverse Shell, but I will try to exploit it for the wp rce way
with the exploit (FTP) got a root shell, with the other way got a www-data shell
