First I enummerate with basic nmap, and a nmap with more resources (nmap-stapler.txt) 
There is too many ports opens and many vulns, I will see the ftp firts because its appers to be annonymouns loggin allowed


In FTP server I got the note.txt (in the note have 2 names "probably it will be user/admins").

After a tried to loggin as root on SSH and I've got more informations (new user)

(smb-stapler.txt)
And enumeratin the SMB I got more users, on SMB in the kathy stuff I possible to discover a new neme Initech (Probably a enterprise name)
and on the Fred stuff (//Fred//tmp) is possible find a ls command output with some hash 

taking a look to the HTTP server on port 12380, in there is a another user, and more "users" on source code,
stil working on HTTP I used nikto to scan vulns on web server   

on the web server have a login page https://192.168.2.179:12380/blogblog/wp-login.php maybe i will do a brute-force on login with the users
Running a WP-SCAN on login page found more user, and a upload directory, and one theme have a vulnerability 
/usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/php/webapps/39646.py that allow a LFI wich returns the wp-conf "1311208608.jpeg", on these file have the root credenciais
of the Mysql

Try to login on mysql server (mysql-stapler.txt), after found and crack the root hash of the mysql, i loged on the web-server
with john credentials (hash.txt) and now I'll upload a reverse shell on plugins page 

In the system the kernel is vulnarable to a priv esc exploit "/usr/share/exploitdb/exploits/linux/local/39772.txt"
Boooom rootshell was droped

----------REMAKE-------------

Well I'm remaking some CTF's and in these I really need to notice some cool way to get rshell
In this machine I found a upload directory on web-server
and the theme for wordpress have a LFI exploit (39646.py)
wich returns the wp-config as a jpeg file, with this 
I got access to phpmyadmin, and there is a cool thing to-do to got a RCE
on phpmyadmin we can execute mysql commands and if you use this:
SELECT "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?> INTO OUTFILE "path-to-upload-dir"

on upload local you can execute commands by the URL
