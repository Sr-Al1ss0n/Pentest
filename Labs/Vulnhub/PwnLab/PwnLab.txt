I started with a network scanning (nmap.txt)
on the web page have links to some pages (home, login, upload)
but first I will try a directory fuzzing (dirbuster.txt)
I've exploring the web-server and to acceess the upload page, the user
need to be logged, I tryed the defaults passwords and nothing worked 
using nikto to do a Vulnscan (nikto.txt)
I used burp to try brute-force LFI because the web-server every time the user 
go to a page the web-server request a file in url "?page=login"
after this I found some pice of code encondec with base64 on the response of
the requests made by burp with LFI.txt payload 
looking at all this responses I've found a mysql credentials
loggend on mysql server and extrated users and passwords (mysql.txt) the password is enconded with base64, just decoded it and logged on web-server
I uploaded a php Remote code Execution code and I've using it by burp to get a reverse shell 
(php-RCE.png".php" ,RCE.png) 

got a www-data shell, used a kernel exploit to priv esc (dirtcow)
