on wp-admin nruteforced login and password
admin:admin
ALWAYS TRY TO GUESS THE LOGIN & PASSWORD  BEFORE BRUTE-FORCE
loged and used the plugin (slideshow gallery) to upload a reverse shell and got access

I used a command to get passwords inside php files
and found mysql credentials
root:mysql
used this on mysql and in phpmyadmin
in one table I found the user "stinky" credentials
used su to login in stinky, on ftp I found mrderp credentials
and login, these user can execute everuthing as root on ~/binaries/derpy* 
so create a dir with this name and a bash file wich execute a reverse shell
used sudo and got a root shell
