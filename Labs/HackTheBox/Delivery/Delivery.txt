starting with a nmap but it takes soo long (nmap.txt)
so I'm manualy see what the machine have
http://10.10.10.222/, I'll do a fuzzing while I'm reading the source code of the web page (gobuster.txt)

==============Pages===============
http://helpdesk.delivery.htb
http://delivery.htb:8065
http://helpdesk.delivery.htb:8065/
http://helpdesk.delivery.htb/
==================================
well, on port 80 have a web-server and on port 8065 have a "mattermost"
every page with this port brings to 8056(helpdesk), 80(delivery) 

on helpdesk page have a "open ticket session" I'll try to create one
with a xss code, this xss didn't work,

SrAl1ss0n@gmail.com:   SrAl1ss0n@delivery.htb
6548383@delivery.htb:  6335016@delivery.htb
                       Teste12345.

with @gmail, i gotta a access denied, used @delivery.htb to on emial to create
a ticket, now openned the ticket and I can access with the my email @delivery.htb and the ticket 
I will use the mattermost to create a account because what is wrote on
http://10.10.10.222/#contact-us:

"""
For unregistered users, please use our HelpDesk to get in touch with 
our team. Once you have an @delivery.htb email address, you'll be able 
to have access to our MatterMost server.

when we create a ticket it provide us a @delivery.htb email, and with
this I can create an account on mattermost-server !!!
