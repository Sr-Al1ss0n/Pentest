 <h1> Hello World ! </h1>
 <h3> it's a experimental web-site </h3> 
 <p>Here I will post my notes about CTF's and soon <b>or not</b> I will upload some tools wich I will develop wich could help in Pentesting and Capture The Flag.  
 The porpuse of this site is encourage me to keep writing my experiences with information security and offensive security and share some knowledge with everybody.</p><br>
 <p>I started my studies one year ago <b>2020</b> with free courses about pentesting and CTF's in this time I made some notes and grouped some interesting things like my notes about Labs, PrivEsc tools and scripts, Reverse Shell codes and Wordlists to do brute-force and password spray.</p><br> 
<p>Most part of my <a href="Pentest/Labs">Labs</a> notes is about machines on vulnhub and a piece of hackthebox machines and tryhackme rooms, I take this notes when I'am playing the CTF so probably it could be confus when you read it without playing the machine</p><br>
<p><a href="Pentest/PrivEsc"> Privilege escalation</a> sessions is a group of tools and codes wich could help your or me to priv esc in a linux michine <b>soon I will put things about windows priv esc too</b>, but now I'm focus in hacking linux machines</p><br>
<p><a href="Pentest/RevShell">Reverse shells</a> session is a group of files to get reverse connection with diferents languages and some ways to obfuscate the files or bypass some security police or tool</p><br>
<p><a href="Pentest/Wordlist">Wordlist</a> sessions is a group of text file wish I use to get access by doing brute-force when necessary, it's very usefull in some CTF's situations<br><br>
