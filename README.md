Hello World !
=============

## it's a experimental git

Here I will post my notes about CTF's and soon **or not** I will upload
some tools wich I will develop wich could help in Pentesting and Capture
The Flag. The porpuse of this site is encourage me to keep writing my
experiences with information security and offensive security and share
some knowledge with everybody.




 I started my studies on **2020** with free courses about
pentesting and CTF's in this time I made some notes and grouped some
interesting things like my notes about Labs, PrivEsc tools, scripts,
Reverse Shell codes and Wordlists to do brute-force and password spray.



- Most part of my [Labs](https://github.com/Sr-Al1ss0n/Pentest/tree/main/Labs) notes is about machines on vulnhub
and a piece of hackthebox machines and tryhackme rooms, I take this
notes while I'm playing the CTF, so probably it could be confus when you
read it without playing the machine



- [Privilege escalation](https://github.com/Sr-Al1ss0n/Pentest/tree/main/PrivEsc) sessions is a group of tools and
codes wich could help your or me to priv esc in a linux michine **soon I
will put things about windows priv esc too**, but now I'm focus in
hacking linux machines



- [Reverse shells](https://github.com/Sr-Al1ss0n/Pentest/tree/main/RevShells) session is a group of files to get
reverse connection with diferents languages and some ways to obfuscate
the files or bypass some security police or tool



- [Wordlist](https://github.com/Sr-Al1ss0n/Pentest/tree/main/Wordlists) sessions is a group of text file I use
to get access by doing brute-force when necessary, it's very usefull in
some CTF's situations
